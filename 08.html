<blockquote>
<p>makeCluster(8, &quot;Fork&quot;) &lt;- this command sends both previous command and data to the cluster clusterCall(cl, summary ,data) &lt;- sending data again # better to use clusterEvalQ instead &lt;- don't execute anything here but # send the expression inside the () and ask the remote nodes to execute it</p>

<li>data parallelism - split data by year then send them to each node</li>
<li>clusterEvalQ &lt;- have R look for data in search path all the way to the parent environment<br /> -&gt; check environment of a function: environment(f)</li>
<li>how R look for variables -&gt; look at parent environment...</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="other-interesting-r-command">Other interesting R command</h1>
<p>apropos() &lt;- find objects by partial name in R debug(function) sys.frames() &lt;- call frame R is very lazy ... it holds on to the expression as long as it does not have to evaluate a variable unless it needs to</p>
<p>how R does search -&gt; parent, first package that it loads etc. use &gt;search() # to see the search path</p>
<p>read about &quot;lexical scoping&quot; if something goes weird about how R fetches variable always from the global parent environment first... See http://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2011/11/23/lexical-scope-and-function-closures-in-r/ for a bizarre example vs dynamical scope</p>
<p>FORK &lt;- put data on shared memory so every node can see it if we do clusterapply &lt;- could be creating data for each function....</p>
<p>global variables &lt;- kiss of death for parallel computing.....since we don't know which process has modified the global variables</p>
<p>careful how the state of random seed of each node is .... wanna set them separately and explicitly -&gt; clusterSetRNGStream</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When should I care about using threads for parallel computing? Threads are used for task parallelization, right? -&gt; can share memory among nodes</li>
<li>When do I care about using stack / heap memory when trying to do parallel computing? Assuming I am using a compiled language. I do want to avoid stack overflow right? but stack is faster.</li>
<li>Do you care about us using a cluster for the assignment?</li>
<li>In a shell, is there a better / alternative way to run jobs in parallel other than just starting different processes followed with ampersand in the command?</li>
<li>How is a language being reflective different from having objects being polymorphic?</li>
