We have to install various packages.
If you don't have administrative privileges, you can install
into your local directories.
First, set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to a local directory, e.g.
export PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages

Now, download the nltk tar.gz file and extract its contents.
Then
cd nltk-2.0.4

Now we can install the module with:

python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/local


To perform Part of Speech analysis, we need extra data,
just as we did for Java's openNLP. We can do this
in python directly with:

import nltk
nltk.download('maxent_treebank_pos_tagger');



There is a freely available book on Python and NLP
