Lecture 16 
==========
Natural language processing 
-----------
* downloading NSF grant proposals in batch
* in xml formats

XML
---
```r
# XPath
library(XPath) #not sure if this is correct
doc = xmlParse(ff[1])
node = getNodeSet(doc, "//AbstractNarration")[[1]] #select the first element
xmlValue(node)
```

Five functions that you need for XPath
* xmlName - name of the XML elements
* xmlAttrs
* xmlChildren
* xmlGetAttr
* xmlSapply

xmlParse() - get the file
xmlRoot() - gets topmost nodes so you can  walk the tree nodes
getNodeSet - grab nodes in the tree
Do not use xmlTreeParse() - will not be able to use getNodeSet this way



relevant libraries
----------
* openNLP - interface to the library in Java - depends on RJava
* NLP - only provides infrastructure
* DBI - same

NLP
----
```r
library(openNLP)
pos_ann = Maxent_POST_Tag_Annotator() # constructor

```
* can get the probability of openNLP getting the POS correctly  
* can analyze latex documents if there are grammatical mistakes 
* can label the wrong words and let openNLP to learn about wrong words 

ROpenSci
------
<http://ropensci.org/>

OAuth
----
present authentication methods for websites 
* v1 
* v2
* 3-legged login
* have to get the token.... for negotiation
digitally signed - cannot be modified

JSON
----
* metadata : content

[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)
---------
* Apache project
* can install on machine 

RCurl package
-----
```r 
library(RCurl)
getURLContent("")
library(RJSONIO)
fromJSON()
getForm()
httpPut() # can add metadata and specify what type of data if a certain
#piece of text is encountered
```

Other technologies
----------
* REST API - representation state transfer - for the ElasticSearch 
* shards - google terminology of different batches of a data
* JavaScript Object Notation style

Requests for websites (Web API)
--------------------
* GET - has corresponding functions in R package, just use http* where *
is one of the four options listed here  
* PUT  
	* sender gets to decide if the info sent is in body / url
	* put in the body if data is too big or 
	* if data cannot be represented as strings  
* POST    
	* receiver gets to decide if the info sent is in body / url
	* 
* DELETE

* WADL documents (if available then do programmatically for REST) 
	* descriptions for code - generate code from documentation in R 

* Simple object application protocol (SOAP)
	* going out of fashion
	* more flexible 
	* a lot more complicated 
SVG 
---
* animated plots based on mouse movements
* dialect of XML
* description of what to draw
