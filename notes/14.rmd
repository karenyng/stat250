How to download data to remote machine with login screen
-----------------
* cookie - signature of the user -   
get data
<http://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-closed-questions-on-stack-overflow/data>
open developer tools on firefox and examine the cookie information - then
copy the cookie over to remote machine then can use wget 

curl -v -L --cookie 'cookie' 'linkLocationForloginToGetdata' > dataFileName

How to unzip 7zip file
-----------
use the command 
	$7z 
or what 's called p7zip when you try to download it 

StackOverFlow questions - not a real question? not constructive? etc.  
-------
* should content of the question tell you if it is a valid question or
* not? NLP! 
* stemming - identify words that are the same but in different tense etc.
* can do Naive Bayes 
* also have to get rid of the markdown symbols - knitr might be able to help 

Open NLP
------
* Java library for doing NLP
* can call Java code within R 

How to read html table from the web
-------
In R, use the function 
* readHTMLTable(URL, ) from the XML package 
There is a column class for striping the data in the proper type  
If there is an annoying comma separating the numbers every 3 digit, 
use 
* gsub() 

html tags 
-------
* th - table headers 
* tr - table row 
* td - table data 

Commands 
--------
* r = xmlRoot(doc)
* xmlName(r) <- tells you what type of file it is 
Other relevant packages: 
----------
* RHTMLForms 
* RCurl 
* RJSON
* RJSONIO

Webscraping - How to find a table from a html file 
-------
  #XPATH - a path through the html tree  
* xmlName()
* xmlSize()
* xmlSApply()

Want to get the ahref tags so that we can pull some links for downloading
the 7zip data file from stackoverflow website
* getNodeSet(filename, "//a[start-with, [ahref]' and ancestor::table]") <- not exact syntax  
* can place condition in a sideway direction, upwards the html tree-like
structure etc. 

* a table in a website could be styled by a CSS 

Parse a html document 
> page <- htmlParse(URL)

get javascript code from the parsed document  
jscode = getNodeSet(page, "//script")

jscode - 2 types  
* inline code  
* has to be downloaded from server 

uuid - universally unique id 

RCurl function 
* getURLContent(URL, binary = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)


HTTP 1.1 dialect code for using RCurl
-----
server response 
200 -succeeded
404 - not found 
500 - server internal error 
300 - we saw it ...


R commands 
----------
If we have some txt string read.csv can read from a connection 
> read.csv(textConnection(txt))
