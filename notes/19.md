Lecture 19
---------
rCharts 

js library
-------
* raphael - for drawing 
* morris plot - js lib
 
* min.js - no spaces to minimize size for transmission

css 
----
```<style></style>
```

using rCharts
------------
```
m1$set(pointSize = 0, lineWidth = 1)
```
* set is a method of m1

S4 classes - how to add hoverCallback js function from within R
-----------
* reference classes 
```
m1 <- mPlot(blah blah blah) 
unclass(m1)
ls(m1) # m1 is a S4 object now you unclass and examine its content
m1$html # call the html method of m1 which is a mPlot js object
# now can get the html file for the m1 plot then add hoverCallback
library(XML)
getNodeSet = blah blah
setNodeValue # or some function like that 
```

possibly useful packages
-------
* gridSVG
* instead of libcairo

how to add stuff in lattice 
--------
```
require(lattice)
xyplot(something something, panel = function(x, y))
grid.ls()
```
* can add panel objects 
* have a tree of objects 

how to produce SVG in R

How to run two pieces of local js and avoid security violation
-------------
* two javascripts cannot communicate unless they run from the web server
* system preference - Mac 
	* WebSharing
	* can figure out the host for a local machine i.e. the /Users/ directory 
* can control google earth plugin using js  
* generate kml using XML package inside R ....
* RKML
* can embed google earth within chrome
* if there is a svg line saying parent.setValue -- it is a security
violation unless the parent and the pieces of code calling the parent are from the same host 

js debug
-------
```
alert("blah blah blah")
```

local smoothing
---------
* in R 
* loess 
* lowess  
* move the smoother - call loess data
* drew scatter plot in R 
* drew all possible values of smooth curve 
* hide them all 
* except for the current one 
* takes a lot data
* go back to R , compute the value and have it update the plot
