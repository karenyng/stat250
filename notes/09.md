Lecture 8 
=========
"R underscore alloc" R will actually clean memory if you hit control C! 
If we use call C from R and use malloc <- if you terminate the code,
there would be memory leak.....

If we have to stick with R ....
==========================
read.csv(con, nrow = totallines) <- preallocate memory will avoid having to
grow memory and speed up the code 

can use read.csv for only extracting one column
colClasses = (NULL, NULL, NULL, ..., the column that we want, ..., NULL)

*.csv <- globing NOT regular expression!

Shell way of parallelization  
=====
grep -v 1987.csv 1988.csv ... 1992.csv | ... > early & 
grep -v 1993.csv 1988.csv ... 1998.csv | ... > mid & 

where early / mid / late are frequency tables and we can just combine them

But hard to find out if the processes finished or not have to look up the
PID and possibly check through the top command.

Duncan's answer to hw2 
=====================
fs = [list of file names]
ff = function(fs) for (f in fs) setfreqtable(f)
cl = makeCluster(10, "FORK")
tables = clusterApply(cl, ff, f)

if we have a 100 files and we have 10 cores,
to divide the files in groups for 10 do:
ClusterSplit(cl, ff) #give a list of character to equally distribute them  
g = clusterSplit(cl, ff)
clusterApply(cl, g, f)

clusterApplyLB <- load balancing!
