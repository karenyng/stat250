<ul>
<li>doing it exactly
<ul>
<li>summation could overflow at some point have to be careful!</li>
<li>if minutes are finite integers - count occurances by histograms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>sampling from file still requires O(N) runtime since have to traverse through the file
<ul>
<li>count # of lines (exclude header)</li>
<li>then uniformly draw n numbers from those lines,</li>
<li>sort the n numbers in ascending order</li>
<li>grab the relevant data during traversal (R can grab by columns)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Don't want to open the file to read for n times</li>
<li>make a connection to the file so R doesn't read from the beginning everytime?</li>

<p>$cons = file(filename) have R skip to different lines.......</p>
