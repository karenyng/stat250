Lecture 2 01/09/2014 - read large amount of CSV 
=========
Possibilities for assignment: 
* R - one line at a time 
* R - one block at a time
* shell - frequency table, then use R to compute  
* use Python - one line at a time 
    * use Python pandas 
    * use Python numbas?
* use low level languages either C/C++ or Java
  * Rcpp can do garbage collecting 
* Do it in relational database 

Challenge accepted!
* maybe use Duncan's package......: FastCSVSample (~6 times faster than
read blocks in R) 

'''{r}
# make a file connection
con = open("file", "r") 
# compute how many lines to skip with delta
readlines(con, delta[i])[delta[i]]
'''
