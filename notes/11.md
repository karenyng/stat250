Lecture 11
===========

Hadoop 
-------
there is a difference between the two APIs...

* streaming API?? running count 
  Hadoop tolerates three errors then shuts every thing down 
	
Java API?
* has better type specification and will be easier to debug

K nearest neighbors (classification) 
--------------------
* compute Euclidean distances for every observations 
* find the smallest distances, assume k = 3  
* do cross validations  
* compute distance matrices 

linear regression
----------------
* constant variance - if variance is not constant - use weighted least
  square  
* independence 
* normal errors 

GLM (generalize linearize model) 
-----------
* iterative fitting 
* Poisson regression?

Ask if flight is gonna be late or not 
------------
* logistical regression ! (for classification)
* boosting - read 242 notes at

Analysis techniques 
--------
* discriminant analysis
* SVM
* decision trees -   

Computing distances in R - relevant packages 
----------
* dist()
* fast nearest neighbor
* R part & parties ( for doing partitions)

Quote of the day
--------
Think about how to do stuff in parallel / fast
