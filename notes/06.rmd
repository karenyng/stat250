How to sample a PDF 
-----------------------------
* inverse CDF sampling e.g. sample some PDF from 1 to 12, 
have 1 to 12 on y axis, have the CDF on the x-axis, 
uniformly sample y values -> map to some x-values 
 
* acception - rejection sampling 

Can do MLE to find what's the best place to start MCMC 

* profiles the R code and see where the bottle neck is 
  then write C code to speed only the slow bits up

Code up on Stat250 MCMC github
-----------
* write skeleton first then fill in details 
* double * int <- may complain depending on the compiler, so better type
casting the variables as double first    

* 1 in R is 2 in C for the index??????

* tell compiler where to find rmath 

* .RCall ? .C ? 
* R CMD COMPILE inclass.c #then R will tell gcc how to find the Rmath library
* n[0] # when n is a pointer, then you have to do n[0] in order to find the value??
* the shell can only see the function call in main()
