Lecture 5
========

Requirement for the homework
-----------------
* plot for comparing the runtime of the different methods
* instructions on how to run the code 
* dependency

different packages 
-----------------
* plyr <- make apply functions sane and uniform
* dplyr <- faster C++ implementation 
* bigmemory 
* OpenBLAS <- call Fortran code?
* ATLAS - BLAS -> takes forever to build and it will optimize the package
during compilation  

compiler technology???
--------------------
* rllvm - use package to generate machine language!
* clang - allow people to build compiler 

* loop fusion -> fusing a bunch of loops 
  e.g. sum(log(dnorm(x)) <- has to loop 3 times in R   
  but if use rllvm 

* just in time compilation -> just tell CPU to split data during computation 
* RLLVMCOMPILE 
* FastR -> different implemntation of R on java virtual machine 
  	* Graal
	* Truffle 
	* new R interpreter - pqR 
* Renjin?

Subsetting R dataframe
----------------------
# give it as string don't evaluate it  
```r{
e = quote(df[ x < 10 & y > 11 & z > mean(z) ] ) 
str(e) # this returns the command as how the code will be interpretted  
e[[1]] # useful for changing R code into other languages, R -> SQL 
}

Question for myself
------------
* difference between uniary operator / binary operator???

Debugger
-------
R -d gdb #can run R inside gdb for debugging purposes
