Lecture 1
=========
* Natural language processing 
* Hidden Markov model for inferring if a word is a subject / object / verb
etc.?

Approaches to computing mean of ArrDelay (in mins) for 20+ years of data 
----
* doing it exactly 
    * summation could overflow at some point have to be
careful! 
    * if minutes are finite integers - count occurances by histograms 

* sampling from file still requires O(N) runtime since have to traverse
 through the file 
    * count # of lines (exclude header)
    * then uniformly draw n numbers from those lines, 
    * sort the n numbers in ascending order 
    * grab the relevant data during traversal (R can grab by columns) 

Shell commands: (242 deja vu....)
----
* gunzip -c
* wc -l  
* sort
* uniq -c 

R commands:
----
* Don't want to open the file to read for n times 
* make a connection to the file so R doesn't read from the beginning everytime?

$cons = file(filename)
have R skip to different lines.......
