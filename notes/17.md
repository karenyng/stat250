Visualization
--------
* Recommended book: Interactive Data visualization for the Web
* oakland crimespotting - REST API to get dataframe
* map API - have to subset dataframe based on what viewing area is available...  
* developer tools - javascript console in browser that you can use  
* event driven programming - to call the code asynchronously 


What plots to make
------------------
* histograms - bar plots
* how many dimensions should we represent? 
	* Tufte 
	* Bill Cleveland 
		* written books on graphics
		* lattice plots / conditional plot
	* use one dimension for each variable 
* pie charts are bad 
	* human perceptions makes it hard to compare the size of slices 
	* starting point of the slices may fool the reader
* dot plots are better!
* table - used for looking up values - plots tells relationship
* Banking 
	* getting the aspect ratio right relative to the data		  
	* so that the significant features - are significant vice versa 
* Wainer 
* Ware 

```{r}
# pch controls everything else 
plot(x,y, col=BLAH, pch=, symbols=BLAH, xlim, ylim)
```
* can make sure that the scale on the charts  
* can use thermometer as symbol and fill it with temperature in R! so cute... 

* R package 
	* animation package 
	* interface to google vis
* interpolation between years
* if view animated gif in a movie viewer can use the slider 

html
----
* each element has a class tag class = "name-of-class"
* can specify style in another part of html code <style> name-of-class </style>  
* can have inline javascript code <script type="text/javascript">script</script>
* prepare data in R and output it in JSON form then have javascript how to plot
* image map

SVG plot & task
--------
* how to make a html displaying a svg plot such that when you click on
 different part of the plot it displays a different plot side by side showing summary statistics
