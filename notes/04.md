R commands 
-----
* gc() #do garbage collection in R want to turn off garbage collection? 

Why interpretted languages is slower than compiled languages:
-----
boxing - the interpretter has to check the syntax and find what the syntax
means , e.g. what "=" does etc. before it can hand the instructions to the
CPU for computation
also the syntax finding is done for every variable / symbol 

compilation bind all the syntax into one big filer so the syntax finding
part is much faster, also the syntax searching is done only once 

R package
-----
tells R to only look for definitions of functions only inside the
package...

compiler <- compiles R code to make it faster

'''r
con <- pipe( blah blah blah, "r") 
something <- readlines(con, rw)
'''
