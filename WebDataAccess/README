This is some of the code that we discussed about
accessing data via the Web.


Recall that the XML package allows us to manipulate
XML documents and extract data from them.
The key functions are

 doc = xmlParse(fileNameOrURL)

 nodes = getNodeSet(doc, "xpath query to access nodes of interest")

 xmlName(node) - name of the XML element, i.e. <table> gives "table"
 
 xmlAttrs(node) - a character vector of the attributes in the XML node
      e.g. <a href="http://www.omegahat.org"  name="bob">...</a>
          yields c(href = "http://www.omegahat.org", name = "bob")

 xmlGetAttr(node, "attrName") retrieves the value of the specified attribute.
       this also allows us to specify a default and also a function to convert the string value of the attribute value.

 xmlChildren(node) - returns a list of the child nodes

 xmlSApply(node, function(node) ...)  / xmlApply(node, function(node) ...)
     applies the function to each of the children nodes





xmlParse() can download documents via HTTP, and then parse them in one action.
However, it cannot access documents via HTTPS, FTP, etc. or access documents 
that aren't simple retrievals (i.e. HTTP GET operations). 
In many cases, we want to submit additional data in the request for a document
such as the parameters

library(RCurl)

data = getURLContent(u)

There are many, many options we can use to customize how the request is performed.
We can see these via

    listCurlOptions()

These are described at http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html

The other functions are
  getForm()
  postForm()
 
and the HTTP verb functions

  httpGET(), httpPOST(), httpPUT(), httpDELETE(), httpOPTIONS(), httpHEAD()
