<h2 id="why-interpretted-languages-is-slower-than-compiled-languages">Why interpretted languages is slower than compiled languages:</h2>
<p>boxing - the interpretter has to check the syntax and find what the syntax means , e.g. what &quot;=&quot; does etc. before it can hand the instructions to the CPU for computation also the syntax finding is done for every variable / symbol</p>
<p>compilation bind all the syntax into one big filer so the syntax finding part is much faster, also the syntax searching is done only once</p>
<h2 id="r-package">R package</h2>
<p>tells R to only look for definitions of functions only inside the package...</p>
<p>compiler &lt;- compiles R code to make it faster</p>
<p>'''r con &lt;- pipe( blah blah blah, &quot;r&quot;) something &lt;- readlines(con, rw) '''</p>
